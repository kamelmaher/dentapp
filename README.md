## 📁 Architecture

### Back-end structure

- `index.js` — app entry point, CORS setup, route registration
- `controllers/` — request handlers for users, clinics, appointments, SMS, and stats
- `routes/` — route definitions for API endpoints
- `models/` — Mongoose schemas for `User`, `Clinic`, `Appointment`, and `OTP`
- `middleware/` — auth, subscription guard, SMS subscription check, validation, and rate limiting
- `validations/` — Zod schemas for auth and appointment payloads
- `services/` — SMS sending helpers and message scaffolding
- `data/` — constants, plans, roles, status text, and clinic defaults

### Front-end structure

- `src/Router.tsx` — page routes and nested dashboard routes
- `src/routes/` — top-level pages like `Home`, `Login`, `Register`, `Clinic`, `Dashboard`, `Pricing`, and `Features`
- `src/components/` — reusable UI pieces, dashboard views, appointment cards, and mobile-friendly sections
- `src/services/` — API clients for auth, clinic, appointment, SMS, and statics
- `src/store/` — state stores for auth, clinic, appointment, and UI data
- `src/config/api.ts` — Axios base client with cookie support
- `src/types/` — typed request/response models for strong TypeScript safety

>
> ```json
> "scripts": {
>   "start": "node index.js"
> }
> ```

### Front-end

```bash
cd front-end
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 💡 Notes

- The backend uses cookie-based auth and `withCredentials: true` in Axios, so the frontend and backend must share a trusted origin.
- SMS support is implemented as a service layer and middleware gate, ready to connect to a real provider.
- The front-end UI is designed for Arabic users, with right-to-left content and clinic branding.
